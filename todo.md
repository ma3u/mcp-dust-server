## Key Dependencies

- [x] MCP SDK v2.3+ (protocol compatibility)
- [x] Dust API stability
- [x] Node.js 20+ (ESM support)
- [ ] Redis 7+ for production sessions
- [x] Support MCP spec compliance (2025-03-26)

## Risk Management

- [ ] Mitigate Dust API changes (Probability: Medium, Impact: High)
  - Strategy: Abstract client layer
- [ ] Handle MCP spec updates (Probability: Low, Impact: Critical)
  - Strategy: Semantic versioning
- [ ] Secure file storage (Probability: High, Impact: Severe)
  - Strategy: Regular audits
- [ ] Prevent session leakage (Probability: Medium, Impact: Critical)
  - Strategy: Encryption-at-rest

## Quality Gates

- [ ] Code Quality: ESLint 0 warnings + 90% coverage
- [ ] Performance: <500ms P99 latency under 1k RPS
- [ ] Security: Zero critical vulnerabilities
- [x] Compliance: Full MCP spec adherence
