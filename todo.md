## Risk Management

- [ ] Mitigate Dust API changes (Probability: Medium, Impact: High)
  - Strategy: Abstract client layer
- [ ] Handle MCP spec updates (Probability: Low, Impact: Critical)
  - Strategy: Semantic versioning
- [ ] Secure file storage (Probability: High, Impact: Severe)
  - Strategy: Regular audits
- [ ] Prevent session leakage (Probability: Medium, Impact: Critical)
  - Strategy: Encryption-at-rest

## Quality Gates

- [ ] Code Quality: ESLint 0 warnings + 90% coverage
- [ ] Performance: <500ms P99 latency under 1k RPS
- [ ] Security: Zero critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] Compliance: Full MCP spec adherence
