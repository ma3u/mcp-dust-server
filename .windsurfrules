### Architecture Analysis:
- Need to bridge MCP protocol with Dust API while maintaining state[1][2]
- SSE required for real-time updates[9]
- use modelcontextprotocol/mcp-core 
- Use the SDK adheres to MCP's JSON-RPC 2.0 messaging format
- use remote (HTTP + SSE) transport mechanisms
- support final MCP specification: https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2024-11-05/
- support latest MCP specification: https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/
- support HTTPStreamTransport and SSE 
- Adding HTTP Stream endpoints in parallel
- implement a session middleware: 
- Using the official SDK for Typescript for Protocol Compliance(Full MCP spec adherence): https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk
- use the core library: https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcp-core
- Implementing protocol version detection

## Security checklist
- Use Zod for all input validation (Source)
- Implement dual transport support (SSE+HTTP)
- Mask PII in logs using regex patterns
- Add health check endpoints (/live, /ready)
- Test with ≥100 concurrent sessions
- Standardized Errors: Use McpError with appropriate error codes for consistent error responses.
- Session Tracking: Use a Map or Redis to track active sessions and associate them with transports.
- Auto-Cleanup: Implement TTL-based session expiration to prevent memory leaks.
Follow the MCP Lifecycle: Implement the three key stages—Initialization, Message Exchange, and Termination.
- Transport Selection: Use SSE for real-time streaming and HTTP for batch processing. Choose transports based on your application needs.
- Environment Variables: Store sensitive data (e.g., API keys) in environment variables and never hard-code them.
- Use the Official SDK: Install the MCP TypeScript SDK to ensure compliance with the latest MCP specification.
- Mask Sensitive Data in Logs: Ensure API keys and session IDs are masked in logs.
- Input Sanitization: Validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
- Caching: Cache frequently accessed resources to reduce latency.
- Concurrency: Use asynchronous programming to handle multiple requests concurrently.

## Dust Integration:
- Analyze Dust SDK patterns[2]
- Agent configuration requirements[7]
- Stream handling best practices[9]
- Use the Dust SDK for Typescript: https://github.com/dust-tt/dust-sdk-js

## Protocol Mapping:
- MCP tools ↔ Dust agent capabilities[1][3]
- Resource management for files[6]
- Error handling across systems[5]

## Performance Aspects:
- SSE connection management[9]
- Conversation context caching
- Timeout handling[4]

## Key Technical Decisions:

1. **Session Management**:
- Session Storage: Use Redis for production deployments
- Validation: Verify session ownership for resource access
- Encryption: Encrypt sensitive context data at rest
- Monitoring: Track session metrics (duration, resource usage)
- Testing: Use MCP Inspector for validation to test server compliance and debug interactions.
- use the Auto-Expiring Sessions: LRU cache with TTL-based cleanup

2. **Streaming Architecture**:
- SSE and HTTPStreamTransport for real-time updates[9]
- Chunked response handling[2]
- Event type differentiation[1]

3. **Security Implementation**:
- Regex-based log masking[11]
- Input schema validation[12]
- Secure resource access control[4]

4. **Dust Integration**:
- Official SDK usage[2]
- Context-aware agent prompting[7]
- Error propagation handling[5]

5. **Documentation**:
- Document all tools, resources, and endpoints clearly for developers and the end users using your server.

## Troubleshooting

- If you have issues with the server implementation, check the reference implementation for type script you can find on the offical website: https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers?tab=readme-ov-file#-reference-servers
